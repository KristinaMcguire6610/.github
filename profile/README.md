## 🚀 My Approach to Development  
I believe in writing clean, modular, and well-documented code. I prioritize performance optimization, security, and scalability in every project. I’m a strong advocate for test-driven development (TDD) and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) practices. Collaboration and communication are key to my workflow, and I enjoy working in agile environments where feedback and iteration are encouraged.  

## 🌱 Current Interests  
I’m currently exploring:  
- **Machine Learning**: Building and deploying ML models with TensorFlow and PyTorch.  
- **Blockchain**: Developing decentralized applications (dApps) using Ethereum and Solidity.  
- **Open Source**: Contributing to open-source projects and building tools for the developer community.
